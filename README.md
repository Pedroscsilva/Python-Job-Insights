# Python Job Insights

This project was fully developed in python in which I processed some files and created some texts to serve a front-end application written in flask.

You can see the following project working with the following steps after cloning it:

1 - Create and enter the virtual environment
```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

2 - Install the project's dependencies
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

3 - Run the flask app
```bash
flask run
```

You should be set!
